Creation of an application for selling artists' creations. The idea is to provide a platform where artists can showcase their works and sell them. Additionally, we can organize events to exhibit their creations in an engaging manner.

Using this online platform, artists will be able to sell their products directly to interested individuals. The concept is to establish an online environment where commerce and artistic creativity naturally intersect, providing both a marketplace for buying and selling and an immersive way to engage with artworks and artists.
