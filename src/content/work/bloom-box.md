Development of an exclusive e-commerce application designed for individuals with surplus mechanical parts, whether new or used, for the purpose of selling them. To initiate the product listing process, users must complete a mandatory registration, including providing relevant contact information. This account serves a dual role: to facilitate product listings for sellers and to offer users the privilege to both explore and purchase products.

Potential buyers benefit from an immersive experience, allowing them to navigate the website, directly engage with sellers, and even provide feedback or recommendations regarding the featured products. Furthermore, for those who have successfully created personal accounts within the system, the platform offers a secure and seamless online payment method, enhancing convenience and trust throughout transactions.
