Development of a mobile application designed to serve as a medication reminder tool. To access its features, users must create an account. Subsequently, an activation email will be sent to the user, facilitating the account activation. Once activated, users can easily input their medications, specifying the intended times for taking them. These reminders can be scheduled for one-time occasions or multiple occurrences, covering daily routines or specific dates.

At the scheduled medication time, the user will receive a notification prompting them to take the prescribed medication. In cases where the medication is not taken after 30 minutes, and if there is no indication of taking it in the application, the medication status will be automatically marked as "missed."

This application further extends its functionality to accommodate users who want to monitor the medication regimen of their parents or children, allowing caregivers to ensure the proper administration of medications.
